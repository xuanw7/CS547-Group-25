Explaining the problem:
We want to prevent future crimes, and our approach would be predicting future crimes and taking measures to avoid that. Currently we are thinking of aggregating the number of each crime by date or by hour, using that and the region information, along with other needed features as we find helpful during our training process, as our features, feeding those into RNN and training the model, then we can predict the primary type of crime for a region at a future time.
