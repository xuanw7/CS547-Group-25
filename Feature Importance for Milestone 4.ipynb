It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

Using the random permutation method, we observed that Feature 1 demonstrates greater importance compared to Feature 0, as it significantly contributes to a positive reduction in the loss. This finding aligns with our experimental results, where including Feature 1 in the dataset leads to a noticeable decrease in the overall loss, further validating its relevance and impact on the model's performance."],"metadata":{"id":"qbaaxqCot0Sw"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"gpuType":"T4"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
